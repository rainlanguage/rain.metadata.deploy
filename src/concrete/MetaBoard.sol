/// delegation into `LibIMetaBoardV1_2` and nothing else. The magic number check
/// and the `MetaV1_2` event live in the library, unit tested there, and this
/// contract adds no behaviour of its own — the equivalence suite in this repo
/// holds each entry point to exactly the library's behaviour.
///
/// `msg.sender` is read inside the library and the internal functions execute
/// in this contract's call context, so the event is emitted by this contract
/// and attributed to whoever called it. See `IMetaBoardV1_2` for the spec: a
/// metaboard is an open bulletin board that anons MAY fill with garbage, so
/// tooling must treat everything indexed from it as untrusted.
